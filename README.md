# São Lourenço da Mata (city): law history in git

The municipal law of the Município de São Lourenço da Mata, Pernambuco (Brazil) as a git history: one file per Artigo, one paragraph per line, so `git blame`, `git log` and `git diff` work line by line. The text is Portuguese, the only official language.

It follows the shared design of [lexifina/global-law](https://github.com/lexifina/global-law).

## What this repository holds

| Folder | Act | Versions |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| `lei-organica/` | Lei Orgânica do Município de São Lourenço da Mata (2008) and every amendment the Câmara's SAPL records | one per period of vigência (9) |

**The Lei Orgânica with its history.** The Câmara's SAPL keeps the Lei Orgânica as a structured text with a view of the text in force for each period between amendments, so each amendment is a commit on the day its period starts, credited to the Emenda à Lei Orgânica that gave it.

Federal law is in [brazil-law](https://github.com/lexifina/brazil-law).

## Source

[Câmara Municipal de São Lourenço da Mata, SAPL](https://sapl.saolourencodamata.pe.leg.br/norma/3), published by the Câmara Municipal de São Lourenço da Mata. Each version names the page it was taken from and that page's sha256, in `data/versions.json`.

## Dates

The first version of the Lei Orgânica is the text SAPL gives in force from 2008-10-02. Each later version is dated by the first day of the period of vigência SAPL gives it and credited to the act SAPL names for it ("Dada por ..."); a period SAPL starts without naming an act is committed as a publisher commit, not guessed. Commits are at noon in São Lourenço da Mata.

## How it is built

Lexifina reads the sources listed here and records each act's dated versions, and the laws that made each change, in one corpus file. `tools/build.py` writes this repository from that file, and the same corpus always gives the same commit hashes; `REPRODUCE.md` gives the details and the checks. A model (Claude) wrote Lexifina's code; it wrote no legal text, and no model runs when the history is built.

Each SAPL view of the Lei Orgânica becomes one file per Art.; each provision is one line, its label followed by its text; headings stand above the first article under them. The notes SAPL keeps under a provision or links into it ("Inclusão feita pelo ..."), provisions it marks as superseded, the amending acts' own blocks it shows inside the text and amendment notes typed into the text ("(Redação dada pela Emenda ...)") are left out.

## How it is checked

Every version is read back from git on the day it took effect (`tools/check_repo.py`) and must match the corpus; an independent letters-and-digits comparison of every version against the source page must show no difference. Results are in `REPRODUCE.md`.

## What "author" means

The author of each commit is the law that made the text, or, for a consolidated text, the publisher, with an e-mail address that cannot exist; the committer is always Lexifina.

## Limits

The record is SAPL's: a version is only as exact as the Câmara's text for it. Ordinary and complementary laws are not in yet. The text is not the official version: only the Diário Oficial do Município is authoritative.
